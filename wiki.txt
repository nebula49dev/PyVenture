Welcome to the Highlands, a vast open world with lots of monsters and enemies.
To play this game, open and run "launcher.py" located in the Resources folder.

At the beginning of the game, you get to choose your weapon. This will decide
what path your story will take.

The sword and bow paths were made by two completely different developers,
which is why the story takes a completely different route depending on what
you choose.
