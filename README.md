# PyVenture
A text-based adventure game written entirely in Python.

> ## Description
> You wake up in a cold dark prison, next to a choice of weapons. It's up to you to
> choose your adventure and to find the ending.

> ## Notes
> - Requires any Python 3 interpreter to run.
> - Necessary info is inside of "wiki.rtf" file. This contains information
> on the story, and how to play.
> - This project is a low priority for me. Don't expect super frequent updates.
> - Inspiration was taken from The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion and Colossal Cave Adventure.
> - This game can be easily ported to any device, since Python is such a universal
> language. Download a Python 3 interpreter on any machine and this game will run.

> ## Changelog v1.0

> - Added main story, keeping the code and the launcher seperate for now.
> - I made sure to place lots of comments for easy edits and modding.
