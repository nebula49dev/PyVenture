# PyVenture
A text-based adventure game written entirely in Python.

## Notes
- Necessary info is inside of "wiki.rtf" file. This contains information
on the story, and how to play.
- This project is a low priority for me. Don't expect super frequent updates.
- Inspiration was taken from The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion and Colossal Cave Adventure.
- This game can be easily ported to any device, since Python is such a universal
language. Download a Python 3 interpreter on any machine and this game will run.

## Changelog v1.0
- First release! ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰
- Added main story, keeping the code and the launcher seperate for now.
- I made sure to place lots of comments for easy edits and modding.
